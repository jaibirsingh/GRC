# What does SIEM monitors
* Network traffic
* Network flows
* System logs
* Endpoint data
* Intel threat feeds
* Security events
* Identity asset context

# Which events are logged in
* Application logs
* System logs
* DNS server logs
* Security logs

# What a SIEM tool does
1. Data Collection
   * Aggregates from different sources
   * Displays on dashboards
   * Configures
   * Securely stores --> Secures the data against any unauthorized access attempt
  
2. Normalization
   * As data is fetched from different systems and applications, the resulting formats are also varied.
   * Converting these formats into useful form manually will not be an efficient way to do it.
   * A SIEM tool saves time by processing logs into a readable and structured format.
  
3. Correlation and Analysis
   * Use the rules and AI to identify patterns in data and breaches
   * And based on these patterns, signals warning for DDoS attacks, virus detection, worm propagation and more.
   * Signature-based detection and Anamoly-based detection
  
4. Event management and Reporting
   * Prioritize events
   * Assigns events to specific individuals or teams
   * Tracks event resolution
   * Reports
  
# Uses of SIEM
* Visibility --> Earlier tools only detect specific endpoints but SIEM tols cover most aspects of IT operations --> This wider view enhances operations and help detect anomalies earlier.
* Threat Intelligence --> Flags possible security threats before the breach actually happens
* Compliance --> NZISM --> Compares Comliance security guidelines to the logged security events
* Incident Management --> Real-time alerts
* Forensics --> Learnigns from past incidents
* Zer-day threat detection --> Updates self with new attack signatures and behavioral patterns
* Cost-efficient --> average cost a of a breach is $3.4 million

# Deployment types for SIEM
1. On-premises deployment
   * Runs on organization's servers
   * Expensive, complex and time consuming
     
2. Cloud deployment
   * Hosted and managed by a vendor off-site
   * Flexible and scalable
     
3. Hybrid deployment
   * Managed partially by Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) and on the organization's own servers.
  
4. SIEM as a service
   * MSSPs provide all services with a centralized SIEM that monitors the cyber security of multiple organizations
  

# SOAR
* Similar to SIEM but adds extra functionality
* Intakes alerts and automatically responds
* Can also take human inputs to stop threats.
* Open source security providers:
    * OSSIM
    * OSSEC
    * SIEMonster
    * Security Onion
 
* Commercial
    *   Splunk
    *   Rapid7
    *   Resolve
    *   ServiceNow
    *   Siemplify
    *   Swimlane
    *   Syncurity
    *   ThreatConnect
    *   ThreatQuotient
