# Threat modelling
Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying and managing potential security threats in a system. It is a proactive process used to analyze and evaluate the security of a system, application, or network by identifying and prioritizing potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. The primary goal of threat modeling is to understand and address security concerns early in the development or design phase of a system, enabling the implementation of effective security controls.
# Common Threat modelling methodologies
Common threat modeling methodologies include STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege), DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability), and OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)

## STRIDE
Out of the different methodologies discussed above, we will delve into the STRIDE methodology. 
In the context of threat modelling, "stride" is an acronym used to categorize different types of threats. Each letter in the term "stride" represents a different category of threats. This framework is commonly used in security engineering and software development to systematically analyze and identify potential security issues. The six categories of threats represented by "stride" are as follows:
1.	Spoofing Identity (S): It happens when authenticity fails. This refers to threats where an attacker may attempt to impersonate a user, system, or component to gain unauthorized access or deceive the system. Here are some common forms of Spoofing:
  *	Email Spoofing: In email spoofing, an attacker forges the sender's email address to make it appear as if the message is coming from a trusted or legitimate source.
  *	Caller ID Spoofing: In phone systems, caller ID spoofing involves manipulating the information displayed on the recipient's phone to make it appear as if the call is coming from a different, often trusted, number.
  *	IP Spoofing: IP spoofing involves manipulating the source IP address in network packets to make it appear as if the traffic is coming from a trusted source. Example: DDoS attack
  *	Website Spoofing: Attackers may create fake websites that closely mimic the appearance of legitimate ones to trick users into providing sensitive information.
  *	Biometric Spoofing: In systems that use biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, biometric spoofing involves attempting to deceive the system by using replicas or falsified biometric data to gain unauthorized access.
  *	User Account Spoofing: This can involve using stolen credentials or employing other methods to deceive authentication systems.
2.	Tampering with Data (T): This involves threats related to unauthorized modification or alteration of data. Attackers might attempt to manipulate data to disrupt system functionality, compromise integrity, or deceive users. Common examples of tampering with data include:
   * Data Modification: Unauthorized changes made to stored data, either in databases, files, or other repositories.
   * Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Intercepting and modifying data as it is transmitted between two parties, often without their knowledge.
   * Code Injection: Inserting malicious code into an application or system to manipulate data or compromise its functionality.

3.	Repudiation (R): Repudiation threats involve situations where an entity denies having performed a particular action or denies the validity of a transaction. This could be used to avoid accountability. Example: Denial of the transaction: A user makes a financial transaction (e.g., online purchase). At a later time, the user denies having made the financial transaction. This denial may occur for various reasons, including genuine disputes (e.g., unauthorized use of their account) or malicious intent (e.g., attempting to commit fraud).

4.	Information Disclosure (I): This category covers threats related to the unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive information. Attackers may attempt to access confidential data or eavesdrop on communication channels. Example: Eavesdropping on Communication: Intercepting and monitoring communication channels to obtain sensitive information being transmitted, such as login credentials or confidential conversations.
5.	Denial of Service (D): Denial of service threats involve attempts to disrupt or degrade the availability of a system or service. Attackers may overwhelm resources, causing the system to become slow, unresponsive, or entirely unavailable. Example: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Coordinating a large number of compromised computers (a botnet) to simultaneously attack a target, overwhelming its resources and causing a service outage.
6.	Elevation of Privilege (E): This category pertains to threats where an attacker gains unauthorized access to higher levels of privilege than they should have. This could lead to unauthorized control or manipulation of the system. Example: Privilege Escalation Attacks: Exploiting vulnerabilities in an application or system to escalate privileges from a lower level to a higher one, potentially gaining access to sensitive functionality or data.
