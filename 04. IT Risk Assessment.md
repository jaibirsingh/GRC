# IT Risk Assessment
* It involves the following steps:
  * Review identified risks
  * Identify controls
  * Priortize mitigation activities
 
## Sections of IT Risk Assessment
1. IT Risk Identification
2. IT Risk Analysis and Evaluation

### 1.IT Risk Identification
* It involves following stages:
  * Risk events
  * Threat modelling
  * Vulnerability and control deficiency analysis
  * Risk scenario devlopment
 
### 2. IT Risk Analysis and Evaluation
* It involves following stages:
  * Risk assessment concepts, standards and frameworks
  * Risk register
  * Risk analysis methodologies
  * Business impact analysis
  * Inherent and residual risk

# Risk Assessment Techniques
## Scenario Analysis
* This analysis involves asking the question "If something bad happens related to ...?". For example: "What if the system server goes down unexpectedly, how bad would that be for the business?"
* It can be implemented through various methods:
  * Brainstorming
  * Structured What-If Technique (SWIFT)
  * Delphi method
## Social Engineering risks 
  * Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) --> Assessing risks focussing on the people involved
  * Sneak Circuit Analysis ---> Assessing risks from the technological point of view.
  * Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) --> Focusses on the process risks

## Focus on hazards
  * Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP) --> Threats most likely to affect the business processes if we  deviate from the defined procedures
  * Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) --> Based on the HAZOP guidelines factoring in the effectiveness of the current controls
 
## Physical Risks
  * Environemental risk assessment
  * Reliability-centered maintenance --> Based on the risks with the hardware involved

## Data Analysis
 * Cause and effect --> Involves using past trends and incidents shown by data to avoid similar incidents in future
 * Root cause analysis --> Figure out where the security incident has begun to resolve it by focussing at the level where it started.

## Tree Analysis
  1. Fault tree analysis
     * Top-down approach which begins with the fault and approaches down to figure out what events caused that fault.
    
  2. Event tree analyis
     * Bottom-up approach which focusses on the events that could occur and then list down the faults associated with these events
    
## Bow tie analysis
* It gets its name from the visual representation of the different aspects associated with a hazard.
* The bow tie analysis helps visualize the relationships between potential causes (threats), preventive measures (barriers on the left side), the hazard event (central knot), consequences (on the right side), and mitigative measures (barriers on the right side).
* This only works if the data regarding past events is correct.

## Bayesian analysis
* This technique uses all the available data in an effort to find patterns among that data.
* Based on those patterns, we try to inference the probability of what might happen next.

## Markov analysis
* Contrary to the Bayesian analysis, this method takes past and present trends into consideration.
* It takes into account the fact that there is a possibility of a hazard happening even if it hasn't happened in the past.
* the risk to assist is based on system's current state.

## Monte-Carlo simulation
* Starts with info. anout asset and controls
* Modify controls
* Measure how changes might impact risks

## Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
* Focusses on the poptential impact to the usiness if the system is taken offline or damaged.
* Make sure the contractual or regulatory requirements are taken into account.
* Not only limited to the hazard management, but BIA can also be used to make recommendations to the businesses to make strategic investments.

# Risk Assessment methodologies
## Difference between Analysis and Assessment
* **Analysis** --> Breaks down the whole thing to examine the individuaal components
* **Assessment** --> Makes a judgement to determine the course of action

* There are two different type of Risk Assessment methodologies:
  1. Quantitative Risk Assessment
  2. Qualitative Risk Assessment
 
## Quantitative Risk Assessment
* Analysis include numbers and statistics. EG: What number of employees fail the last Phishing simulation test.
* Usually starts with numbers and costs
* Results in financial calculations
* **Method followed** --> Factor Anlysis of Information Risk (FAIR)

## Qualititative Risk Assessment
* This methodology is used if enough or reliable data is not present for risk assessment
* Usually starts in possible risk scenarios
* Generally results in estimated scores.
* It is based on opinions and personal experience.
* Eg: If it is asked to the employee that whether you believe the risk is high, medium or low, then a Qualitative risk assessment is being performed.

# Risk rankings
* According to a template in "NIST guide for conducting risk assessments", the severity of following categories have to be categorised on the scale of 1-5:
  1. Threat event
  2. Threat sources
  3. Threat source - Capability
  4. Threat source - Intent
  5. Threat source - Targeting
  6. Relevance
  7. Likelihood of attack initiation
  8. Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
  9. Severity and pervasiveness
  10. Likelihood that the initiated attack succeeds
  11. Overall likelihood
  12. Level of impact
  13. Risk
 
* Then we can check the severity of the threat according to this matrix:

# Threat modelling
* The process of identifying the people or things that might harm the organization

## Threat Model elements
1. Threat actors
   * Might include script kiddies, cyber criminals, state-sponsored agents, malicious insiders, auhtorized partners, suppliers, regulators, etc.
  
2. Threat types
   * The question to be asked here is that "Are the Threat Actors intentionally targetting our systems or an insider accidentally chain something that took a critical system offline?"
  
3. Threat events
   * "What action does the Threat actor takes?"
  
4. Assets/ Resources
   * Here we need to consider the assets or resources that might be affected because of the threat which include applications, DBs or other IT infrastructure, etc., and also might include the people and processes who use that technology.
  
# Criteria-based analysis
## 1. Analyze organizational structure
   * Questions to be asked here are:
     * What's the roel of your risk amnagement team?
     * Are they hesitant to discuss the risks involved in the processes of the organization or not?
     * What risks are they able to assess and influence?
     * Are any areas of the business off limits to your team?
    
## 2. Analyze policies, standards and procedures
   ### What are Policies?
    * High-level documents that contain the senior management's expectations

   ### What are Standards? 
    * Policies might include the goals of the organization, but the path that needs to be paved to achieve those goals are defined by the Standards.
    * Eg: Policy might say that "Enable the employees to work remotely". How that can be done has to defined in the Standards.

   ### What are Procedures?
   * Step-by step how-to guides to meet the organization's standards
   * Every team in the company should have documented procedures on how to securely do the job that they were hired to do.

  ### Exception document
  * Every exception should be documented.
  * These questions should be included while documenting every exception:
    * Who reviewed and approved it?
    *  When was it requested?
    *  When does it expire?
    *  What are the mitigating controls?
   
## 3. Analyze technology
  ### Identify outdated technology
  ### Make full use of CMDb
   * Configuration Management Database
   * Repository of IT asset information or information related to the deployed technology

## 4. Analyze controls
  ### Preventative controls
  * Aims to stop an attack in its tracks
  * Eg: Preventing a cyber criminal from reading data across the internet by encrypting it.

  ### Deterrent controls
  * Discourage intruders by giving the warnings
  * Eg: The log-in banners that tells that it is illegal to be here.

  ### Directive controls
  * Similar to Deterrent controls, but contains all the do's and don'ts for any stakeholder using the resources.
  * Eg: Remote access policy

  ### Detective controls
  * These type of controls are performed after the attack.
  * Send out alerts when they see something.
  * Eg: Security Information Event Management (SIEM)
