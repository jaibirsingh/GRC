# IT Risk Assessment
* It involves the following steps:
  * Review identified risks
  * Identify controls
  * Priortize mitigation activities
 
## Sections of IT Risk Assessment
1. IT Risk Identification
2. IT Risk Analysis and Evaluation

### 1.IT Risk Identification
* It involves following stages:
  * Risk events
  * Threat modelling
  * Vulnerability and control deficiency analysis
  * Risk scenario devlopment
 
### 2. IT Risk Analysis and Evaluation
* It involves following stages:
  * Risk assessment concepts, standards and frameworks
  * Risk register
  * Risk analysis methodologies
  * Business impact analysis
  * Inherent and residual risk

# Risk Assessment Techniques
## Scenario Analysis
* This analysis involves asking the question "If something bad happens related to ...?". For example: "What if the system server goes down unexpectedly, how bad would that be for the business?"
* It can be implemented through various methods:
  * Brainstorming
  * Structured What-If Technique (SWIFT)
  * Delphi method
## Social Engineering risks 
  * Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) --> Assessing risks focussing on the people involved
  * Sneak Circuit Analysis ---> Assessing risks from the technological point of view.
  * Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) --> Focusses on the process risks

## Focus on hazards
  * Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP) --> Threats most likely to affect the business processes if we  deviate from the defined procedures
  * Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) --> Based on the HAZOP guidelines factoring in the effectiveness of the current controls
 
## Physical Risks
  * Environemental risk assessment
  * Reliability-centered maintenance --> Based on the risks with the hardware involved

## Data Analysis
 * Cause and effect --> Involves using past trends and incidents shown by data to avoid similar incidents in future
 * Root cause analysis --> Figure out where the security incident has begun to resolve it by focussing at the level where it started.

## Tree Analysis
  1. Fault tree analysis
     * Top-down approach which begins with the fault and approaches down to figure out what events caused that fault.
    
  2. Event tree analyis
     * Bottom-up approach which focusses on the events that could occur and then list down the faults associated with these events
    
## Bow tie analysis
* It gets its name from the visual representation of the different aspects associated with a hazard.
* The bow tie analysis helps visualize the relationships between potential causes (threats), preventive measures (barriers on the left side), the hazard event (central knot), consequences (on the right side), and mitigative measures (barriers on the right side).
* This only works if the data regarding past events is correct.

## Bayesian analysis
* This technique uses all the available data in an effort to find patterns among that data.
* Based on those patterns, we try to inference the probability of what might happen next.

## Markov analysis
* Contrary to the Bayesian analysis, this method takes past and present trends into consideration.
* It takes into account the fact that there is a possibility of a hazard happening even if it hasn't happened in the past.
* the risk to assist is based on system's current state.

## Monte-Carlo simulation
* Starts with info. anout asset and controls
* Modify controls
* Measure how changes might impact risks

## Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
* Focusses on the poptential impact to the usiness if the system is taken offline or damaged.
* Make sure the contractual or regulatory requirements are taken into account.
* Not only limited to the hazard management, but BIA can also be used to make recommendations to the businesses to make strategic investments.
