# Phishing
* The act of sending out communications across various mediums to convince to someone to take an action.
* These messages could be send via:
  * Social media
  * Text messages
  * Phone calls
 
## Ways to tackle
* Create awareness on how to recognise the difference between a legitimate email and a phishing one.

## Social Engineering
* It's a technique that uses the knowledge of human behavior to deceive and manipulate people.
* **Examples:**
* 1. A phishing email pretending to be from Apple that warns you of unusual sign-in activity.
* 2. Scam calls telling you that your credit car has been suspended
* 3. Unauthorized individuals entering restricted office spaces.
 
## Pretexting 
* It is the act of creating a persona or backstory that is used to persuade someone into providing private inofrmation or taking some action.

## Vishing
* Phishing attacks made over the phone

## Baiting
* A form of social engineering where an attacker actively or passively takes advantage of a person's greed, shame or curiosity by promising some sort of incentive.
* Best way to deal with baiting is to create awareness among the employees of the company.

## Tailgating 
* When a person gains unauthorized access to an area that requires authorization by using deceptive tactics.

## Shoulder Surfing
* Occurs when a person attempts to gather confidential information by simply looking over your shoulder.
* Solution: Use a privacy screen which obscures what is on the display on your computer for everyone but you.

# Safeguarding your company from attacks
## Cybersecurity awareness training
## Properly manage passwords
* A piece of software that stores your passwords in an encrypted state.
* Make sure to keep track of the master password and change it every few months.

## Install patches

## Spam filter
* To filter the spams, we can use the email headers as they contain inofrmation about the route taken by the email to get to our email addresses, as well as IP addresses or host names of all the stops along the way.
* Spam filters can check the headers that contain IP addresses that belong to the blacklisted IPs

## Sandboxing
* **What is a sandbox**
  * A virtual space  where new or untested software can be run securely
  * It can also be a space where you can execute suspicious software without any harm coming to your machine.
  * Sandbozes are used to capture malwares before they are executed.
 
## Scan attachments
* General way of scanning the attachments to the emails can be:
  * Upload the attachment to VirusTotal
  * Scan attachment with anti-virus
  * Execute in Sandbox to see if any system changes occur or if anything malicious is downloaded
  * Verify with the sender if they have actually send you an attachment.
 
## Anti-social engineering software
* Defense-in-depth concept is used which means adding more and more layers of security measures so that if one fails, there's another layer under that to get through.
* Using an anti-virus is critical
* Setting up firewall on the system as well as network will asdd another layer of security.
* Blocking uncommon ports or the ports that are not used could potentially stop many malicious connection attempts.
* Setting up spam filters.

## Create policies and procedures
* **Need of the policies**
  * If there's a policy in place that tells an employee how company data and systems are to handled for security, there's something in place that warns against certain behaviour.
 
## Phishing simulations
* A fake phishing campaign that is performed on the email addresses associated with the company.
