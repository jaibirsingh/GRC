# What is NZISM
* It is the New Zealand government's manual which explains processes and controls for protecting New Zealand government's information and systems.
* It provides a baseline in the form of security templates that have been developed to assist agencies in understanding the security posture of their cloud environments.
* This manual is intended for use by New Zealand Government departments, agencies and organisations. Crown entities, local government and private sector organisations are also encouraged to use this manual.
* The purpose of this manual is to provide a set of essential or baseline controls and additional good and recommended practice controls for use by government agencies. The use or non-use of good practice controls MUST be based on an agencyâ€™s assessment and determination of residual risk related to information security.
